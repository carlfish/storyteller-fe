Cora makes sure the patrons all have their fill of drink, while her husband Loric's stew fills their bellies. A fire burns in the hearth.\n\nIn the corner near the fireplace, a group of adventurers sit around a table, enjoying a much-deserved chance to relax. Lyra raises a mug of ale that looks far too large for her. \"To us, the finest adventurers this side of the Axe Peaks!\"\n\nBorin chuckles. \"Chases off a couple of orc bandits and she thinks the bards are lining up to write odes about us.\""

That’s a kind of magic, too.” Borin gave a hearty laugh, the sound rumbling through the room, his braided beard catching the fire’s glow as he leaned back proudly. The camaraderie was the kind of magic no evil could break—an unspoken bond forged through countless shared dangers.\n\nFrom her seat, Selindra’s sharp ears caught a faint but unusual noise—an almost imperceptible tap, tap, tapping beyond the tavern door. Her gaze flicked to the window, where the night breathed shadows. The revelry hummed around her, but a ripple of instinct prickled her skin. Something was coming."

His hand instinctively moved to the handle of his axe, eyes narrowing toward the door. “I don’t like the feel of this either. Ravens don’t usually announce themselves with a knocking rattle.”\n\nThe tavern’s warmth suddenly felt brittle, as if the fire flickered to match the unease growing between them. Selindra slid from her seat with a fluid grace, the silver strands of her hair catching the hearthlight like spun moonbeams. She moved toward the heavy wooden door, each step measured and silent.\n\nLyra rose quickly, slipping a small vial from her pouch, fingers curling around the glass as if ready to unleash its contents. “If it’s trouble, let’s be ready. We can’t afford surprises.” The room’s chatter dimmed, all eyes turning to the door where the tapping persisted—a slow, deliberate rhythm that promised no friendly visitor."

Standing in the doorway was a tall man with a scarred face, a mail shirt that had seen better days, a longsword buckled at his side. He stood for a moment silhouetted in the door, to a hushed silence that was only broken by one of the patrons seated by the entrance yelling. \"Shut the door, you idiot, the cold's supposed to stay outside.\"\n\nThe stranger closed the door behind him and trudged over to sit at the bar, quietly ordering an ale from Cora.\n\n\"Did ye see the tattoo on his arm.\" Borin spoke in a low voice. \"Brotherhood of the Red Sword.\"\n\nSelindra looked skeptical. \"If he's a Scarlet Knight, he's a long way from home.

Something’s off—either he’s run from a fight or bringing news worse than the winter chill.”\n\nSelindra’s fingers brushed the hilt of her dagger beneath the table. Her gaze locked on the man’s arm briefly, where the faded crimson sword tattoo peeked from beneath his sleeve. “Or he’s hiding something,” she murmured. The tavern, once filled with laughter, now hummed with wary anticipation as the firelight danced across the cold steel at his side.\n\nLyra, still clutching her vial, leaned in quietly. “Maybe we should speak with him—find out what ghosts trail him here. If he’s alone, he might be desperate or dangerous.” A flicker of cautious determination flashed in Selindra’s emerald eyes; once more, the threat lurking beyond the warm hearth was beginning to stir."

Don't get many strangers around here. Anyway, I'm Lyra, what's your name, friend?\""

I’m just passing through.” He took a slow sip, savoring the warmth of the wine more than the ale. “Not many welcome in Hilverton, I reckon.”\n\nSelindra eased closer, still silent but watching his every move, reading the slightest tension in his stiff posture. Borin grunted from behind her, resting a hand on the battle-axe leaned against the table, ready but patiently waiting. Dain’s glance flickered briefly toward the door, as if haunted by shadows left outside.\n\nLyra’s eyes searched his face for cracks, for the story hidden behind those weary scars. “Passing through, eh? The Brotherhood of the Red Sword doesn’t usually wander alone. You’ve got stories to tell, Dain, even if you would rather keep them locked tight.” His grip tightened slightly around the cup—soon, the truth would spill like the firelight across their tangled fates."

If it’s a path that leads to safety instead of danger, we’ll tread it together.” The hearth crackled, flames casting long, dancing shadows as the four of them settled around the table, the chill of night pushed back by both fire and fragile trust."

We were a dozen knights leading a company of battle-hardened soldiers. Our job was to deliver an ultimatum. As we left, we were set upon by the Baron's men and…\" he shuddered. \"…more.

Twisted things—half-man, half-shadow—lurking beyond the woods near Cragpass. Not natural by any means. Our knights became prey in the night, hunted like animals. I barely escaped with my life... and this message.\" He reached inside his worn cloak, pulling out a sealed scroll marked with the prince's sigil.\n\nBorin’s face grew grim, a low rumble escaping his throat. \"If the Baron’s dealt a hand in such dark dealings, it could tear the whole region apart. We can’t let this fester.” Lyra’s small hand rested on the vial at her belt, determination burning in her eyes. “Then we have a choice—to follow this thread and see where the darkness leads, or bury our heads and hope it doesn’t come knocking.” The fire in their hearts now burned fiercer than the blaze before them."

If darkness is our enemy, daylight is our ally, and we'd be best up in time to make the most of it.\" \n\nSelindra turned to Dain. \"Whether you're running towards or away from the darkness that's chasing you, we'll help.\" Her eyes sparkled, adding after a pause. \"So long as we can trust that the Prince Regent's favour is worth something.\"\n\nWith a petulant sigh Lyra tipped back the mug, downing the last of the ale in one long gulp. \"See you at dawn, Knight.\" The trio departed upstairs to the room they shared above the inn."

We’ll need to be ready for anything at Cragpass.” His voice was low but resolute, a steady anchor against the rising tide of uncertainty.\n\nLyra busied herself arranging herbs and salves on the small wooden table, her fingers deft despite the tension in her shoulders. “We’ll need every ounce of wit and courage, and maybe a little magic, to face what’s coming. If those twisted creatures are real, it’ll test everything we hold dear.” The firelight flickered behind her, casting dancing shadows that seemed to whisper of the trials yet to come."
