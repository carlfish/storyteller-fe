Sora, the barmaid, makes sure all the patrons have their fill of drink, while Loric's stew fills their bellies. A fire burns in the hearth. In the corner, the Companions sit around a table enjoying a much-deserved chance to relax after a long adventure. Jorven raises his mug of ale. \"To us, the best adventurers this side of the Sword Peaks!\" Maelin chuckles. \"I'm not sure fighting a few orc raiders qualifies us for that accolate, but I'll take it.\""

Tonight, our victories are ours to savor without debate.\" The crackling fire casts flickering shadows on his sharp features, as his silver-streaked hair gleams softly. Outside, a faint rustle hints at the stirring night, but within, the merriment holds strong.\n\nJorven's deep voice lowers as he adds, \"Tomorrow, the mountains call again. The orcs won't stay quiet long. We need to be ready—for strategy, for survival.\" Maelin taps her fingers against her mug thoughtfully. \"That reminds me, I found something perplexing in the ruins we explored. A rune etched deep beneath the altar—it might hint at something larger than mere bandits.\" Her lavender eyes momentarily glow, reflecting the firelight and teasing secrets yet to be uncovered."

      "content": "Maelin’s eyes snapped open, the shards of a distant crash ringing sharply in her ears. The tavern’s dim glow flickered and danced wildly as shadows darted across the walls—the shattered glass from a hastily thrown tankard glittering across the floor. Her heart hammered, adrenaline stirring beneath her skin as she sat up, clutching the edge of the rough-hewn table. Voices, harsh and urgent, sliced through the bustle; a scuffle was unfolding outside the common room.\n\nShe glanced toward the tavern’s stout wooden door, noticing Vesarin already rising, his sharp green eyes narrowing with grim calculation. Jorven grunted low and moved to block the doorway, while Sora hurried behind the bar, her face tense but determined. The warmth and laughter that had filled the room only moments before had shifted into a taut silence, pregnant with anticipation and the echo of something far more dangerous lurking beyond."
